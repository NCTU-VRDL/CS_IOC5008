## HW2: Celebrity face images generation

### Goals
Train your generative adversiral network to generat the celebrity face images as real as possible

### Description
- Download the dataset from code provide in [homework2.ipynb](https://github.com/NCTU-VRDL/CS_IOC5008/blob/master/HW2/homework2.ipynb)
- After trained your GAN, generated **9 images** and save it by the "output_fig" function in [homework2.ipynb](https://github.com/NCTU-VRDL/CS_IOC5008/blob/master/HW2/homework2.ipynb)
- This homework will be evaluated by your classmates through voting for realistic (compare to baseline) in class
- Rank top3  will be invited to make a presentation to share your methodology and get a bonus on final score!

### Reports & Results submission
- Submit your results of images (by function we provide) andyour reports to this google drive 
- Your reports (in PDF format) should include
  - GitHub/GitLab repository link
  - Introduction
  - Methodology (Data pre-process, Model architeture, Hyperparameters,...)
  - Findings or Summary
